\section*{Understanding trends through sound}

\noindent This first section will guide you through exploring \ce{NO2} trends through the sonifcation interface. To begin, use the following settings:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item All cities \textbf{ON}
\item Looping \textbf{ON} or \textbf{OFF}
\item Speed \textbf{20}
\item \ce{NO2} \textbf{ON}, \ce{O3} \textbf{OFF}
\item Season filter \textbf{OFF}
\item Synth sound based on location \textbf{ON}
\item Scaling \textbf{RELATIVE TO INDIVIDUAL MAXIMUM}
\item Panning \textbf{SITE LOCATION}
\end{itemize}

\noindent Listen to the data record as many times as necessary to answer the following questions.

\begin{questions}
\setcounter{question}{-1}
\question Please indicate whether you are listening on a stereo or 8-channel setup\\
	\begin{oneparchoices}
	\choice Stereo speakers
	\choice Stereo headphones
	\choice 8-channel
	\end{oneparchoices}


\question \ce{NO2} from cities:
	\begin{parts}
	\part Is the overall trend in cities' \ce{NO2} increasing, decreasing, or staying constant?
	\fiveptincdec
	
	\begin{solution}
	\emph{Strongly decreasing} best, \emph{weakly decreasing} acceptable
	\end{solution}

	\part Rate your confidence in this answer.
	\fiveptgeneric{Minimal confidence}{Extremely confident}

	\end{parts}


\instructions{%
Now turn \textbf{OFF} all the cities and turn \textbf{ON} all the power plants. Leave the other settings the same.
}

\question \ce{NO2} from power plants:
	\begin{parts}
	\part Is the overall trend in power plants' \ce{NO2} increasing, decreasing, or staying constant?
	\fiveptincdec

	\begin{solution}
	\emph{Strongly decreasing} best, \emph{weakly decreasing} acceptable
	\end{solution}
	
	\part Rate your confidence in this answer.
	\fiveptgeneric{Minimal confidence}{Extremely confident}

	\end{parts}


\instructions{%
Now turn \textbf{OFF} all the power plants and turn \textbf{ON} all the rural sites. Leave the other settings the same.
}

\question
	\begin{parts}
	\part Is the overall trend in rural sites' \ce{NO2} increasing, decreasing, or staying constant?
	\fiveptincdec

	\begin{solution}
	\emph{Staying constant} is most correct, some may say \emph{weakly decreasing}
	\end{solution}
	
	\part Rate your confidence in this answer.
	\fiveptgeneric{Minimal confidence}{Extremely confident}
	\end{parts}


\instructions{%
Now turn \textbf{OFF} all the rural sites and turn \textbf{ON} the following cities:
	\begin{itemize} [noitemsep, nolistsep]
	\item Indianapolis, IN
	\item Los Angeles, VA
	\item Reno, NV
	\item San Antonio, TX
	\end{itemize}
Also turn \textbf{ON} the season filter and decrease the speed to \textbf{2}. Turning \textbf{ON} looping will probably help.
}

\question Seasonal variation:
	\begin{parts}
	\part Is the \ce{NO2} in the summer greater or less than in the winter?
	\fiveptmag

	\begin{solution}
	The mean summer--winter difference is $-27.5\% \pm 26.5\%$ ($1\sigma$), the median difference is $-29.8\%$ with quartiles of $[-42.3\%, -19.5\%]$. Therefore, I'd say \emph{slightly less} is the best answer, but \emph{much less} is also valid.
	\end{solution}

	\part Rate your confidence in this answer.
	\fiveptgeneric{Minimal confidence}{Extremely confident}

	\end{parts}

\instructions{Turn the seasonal filter \textbf{OFF}. Reset the speed to \textbf{20}.}	

\question Spatialization:
	\begin{parts}
	\part Which city has the largest relative change in \ce{NO2}? \\
		\begin{choices}
		\CorrectChoice Indianapolis
		\CorrectChoice Los Angeles, CA
		\choice Reno, NV
		\choice San Antonio, TX
		\choice These cities' trends sounded too similar
		\choice I could not identify which city was which
		\end{choices}
		
	\begin{solution}
	Los Angeles and Indianapolis both have slopes of $\sim -4.1\%$ yr$^{-1}$. San Antonio and Reno are much lower, $\sim -1.7\%$ yr$^{-1}$.  If instead we just consider the average of the first and last years, LA changed $-49\%$, San Antonio $-39\%$, Indianapolis $-37\%$, and Reno $-15\%$.
	\end{solution}		
		
	\part Rate your confidence in this answer.
	\fiveptgna{Minimal confidence}{Extremely confident}{Could not tell}
	
\instructions{Change the scaling to \textbf{ABSOLUTE}.}	

	\part Which city has the largest absolute change in \ce{NO2}? \\
		\begin{choices}
		\choice Indianapolis
		\CorrectChoice Los Angeles, CA
		\choice Reno, NV
		\choice San Antonio, TX
		\choice These cities' trends sounded too similar
		\choice I could not identify which city was which
		\end{choices}
		
	\begin{solution}
	Los Angeles has a slope of $\sim -7.3 \times 10^{14}$ molec. cm$^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$. Indianapolis is the next largest at $\sim -2.6 \times 10^{14}$ molec. cm$^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$.  The differences between the average of the first and last year are $-7.3 \times 10^{14}$, $-2.7 \times 10^{14}$, $-0.9 \times 10^{14}$, and $-0.8 \times 10^{14}$ molec. cm$^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$ for LA, Indianapolis, Reno, and San Antonio, respectively.

	\end{parts}
	
	
\instructions{Turn \textbf{ON} all sites. Adjust the speed as needed to answer the question.}

\question Regional trends:
	\begin{parts}
	\part Which region had the greatest \ce{NO2} in 2005?\\
		\begin{choices}
		\CorrectChoice Northeast
		\choice Southeast
		\choice Northwest
		\choice Southwest
		\choice These regions sounded too similar
		\choice I could not identify which region was which
		\end{choices}
		
	\begin{solution}
	I don't have specific numbers for this one at the moment, but the northeast (esp. NY-Philly-NJ-Baltimore-DC) had so much \ce{NO2} their plumes were essentially indistinguishable from space. Los Angeles' signal may be large enough to make the SW a reasonable alternative sonically.

	\fiveptgna{Minimal confidence}{Extremely confident}{Could not tell}
	\end{parts}
	
\instructions{For these next questions, start with only the rural sites \textbf{ON}. Turn on and off the sites and adjust the speed as needed to explore the data and answer the questions. Set scaling to \textbf{RELATIVE TO CATEGORY MAXIMUM}}

\question Trends at rural sites:
	\begin{parts}
	\part Identify the two rural sites with the greatest change in \ce{NO2}.
	\begin{solutionorbox}[1cm]
	Shenandoah and Rural AL
	\end{solutionorbox}
	
	\part Rate your confidence in this answer.
	\fiveptgna{Minimal confidence}{Extremely confident}{Could not tell}
	\end{parts}
	
\instructions{Now, turn \textbf{OFF} all sites \emph{except} Phoenix, AZ. Change panning to \textbf{\ce{NO2}/\ce{O3}}. Change scaling to \textbf{RELATIVE TO INDIVIDUAL MAXIMUM}. Turn \ce{O3} \textbf{ON}. Adjust the speed as needed to answer the question.}

\question \ce{NO2}/\ce{O3} relationship:
	\begin{parts}
	\part Satellite measurements of surface \ce{O3} are highly uncertain, so the data here may not represent the relationship between \ce{NO2} and \ce{O3} accurately. Nevertheless, based on the sonification, would you say \ce{NO2} and \ce{O3} concentrations are correlated, anti-correlated, or have no significant relationship?
	\fiveptcorrna
	
	\begin{solution}
	Technically, the correlation of $\Delta \ce{O3}$ and $\Delta \ce{NO2}$ is negative with a $p$ value of 0. However, the $R^2$ is $< 0.1$, so either ``weakly anti-correlated'' or ``no significant correlation'' are acceptable.

	\part Additional comments about the panning:
	\makeemptybox{1in}
	
	\part If you listened on the 8-channel setup, please comment on the mapping of longitude in the forward and back direction in the panning. Was it intuitive that north = forward or not?
